## 9:00am - 101 Keynote: Intro to BSides Canberra
This talk covers the history and ethos of hackercons in Australia with some tips and advice on how to get the most out of the conference.

## 9:30am - A hacker’s view of DoS attacks - David Robinson
This talk will go over the ways a hacker conducts reconnaissance against an organisation to select targets best suited for a DoS attack. Following that, we will provide methods for defending your organisation and web applications.

DoS attacks are a topic at the front of a lot of people's minds at the moment. This talk will examine how a hacker selects targets within an organisation with a goal of causing the greatest business disruption.
Attackers can find juicy targets in more ways than you would initially think. A range of discovery techniques will be presented. People watching this talk will not be left hanging, as it will finish with how you can protect your assets from DoS attacks (spoiler: a CDN, WAF or DoS scrubbing are not magical cures on their own).

## 1:30pm - Comprehending Kayfabe: a lens for dealing with cognitive hacking, online influence and layered deception - Steven Coomber
Cyberattack is about data and integrity not only network security, as breaches also effect an enterprise’s values, reputation and brand. Cognitive hacking using dis-mis-mal-information is cyberattack aimed at manipulating perception and exploiting psychological vulnerabilities to change behaviour. This makes online influence campaigns across social media, the internet and networking infrastructure a cyber problem and solutions part of the cyber environment. We know disinformation can amplify social tensions and unsettle communities, but to what degree can it be intentionally weaponised on a population without it’s knowledge? The extent of online disinformation damage remains unclear and mostly assumed not proven because it is difficult linking specific measurable indicators. Social media platforms are commercial businesses balancing financial incentives with at least the appearance of social responsibility and as Big Tech ramps up censorship purging dissenting voices, questions continue if this will fix the problem.

## 2:00pm - Ethan Hunt on a Budget - Tim Noise
In the early ages of machine learning we've seen memes, misinformation and music videos. In this talk we look at the concepts of identity - specifically document verification and biometrics commonly used in sectors such as fintech, medical and other major sectors for online verification of identity. We tested (with permission) 4 major vendors in this space and highlight weak spots in both the technology, the concept of identity and call upon the machine uprising to use their own powers against them. live demos, fun and cause for concern.

## 3:00pm - APT Attack Techniques in Azure Cloud - Lina Lau (@inversecos)
Difficult to detect and pervasive in nature, cloud attack techniques attract the likes of APT groups like Nobellium who have increased their focus on abusing identity federation. Techniques like Golden SAML and AD FS skeleton keys provide threat actors the double-edged sword of combining both lateral movement and privilege escalation into a single technique – with the added benefit of leaving little trace in the cloud logs for defenders.

For a long time, compromise and detection has focused primarily on on-premises techniques, but the ecosystem has shifted, and the cloud is the new frontier. As most organizations utilise cloud services in one way or another – it’s only a matter of time before we see commodity threat groups and other nation states abusing these techniques. This talk aims to break down APT techniques in the cloud like Golden SAML and AD FS skeleton keys to demonstrate the wide range of possibilities of cloud compromise, and to highlight the future of cloud attacks and the untapped research potential yet to be uncovered.

## 4:00pm - Case Studies in Point of Sale Hardware Hacking - Zoi Petroulias
Point of sale devices are found in many retail outlets and handle sensitive financial, sometimes personal, information. They're easy to use and easy to reach. It literally pays to wonder, how are they protected? Sometimes there are locks to keep out curious customers, and many devices employ proprietary communications protocols as a barrier against less sophisticated signal sniffing attacks. I recently had the opportunity to conduct security assessments on a couple of such devices. In this talk, I'll explain what hardware hacking techniques I used to perform a black-box analysis of these devices. I'd expect any bad actor to do the same.

## 11:00am - Scudo Allocator exploitation - Zac Ecob
The Scudo allocator is a memory allocator designed primarily for C/C++. Designed as part of the LLVM project, it has gained popularity as an alternative choice to allocators like ptmalloc2, most prominently being used as Android's default allocator since Android 11. Scudo aims to provide efficient memory allocation and deallocation whilst mitigating common vulnerabilities such as heap buffer overflows, use-after-frees, and double frees. As the risk associated with these vulnerabilities continues to rise, scudo is primed to become more and more of a prominent choice for developers to use.

This talk will cover a high-level overview of the current, as well as completely new, exploitation techniques related to the scudo allocator. We will run through the inner workings of the allocator, looking at security-based design choices such as quarantine regions, randomized allocation, red-zone regions, and hardened headers. Then, we'll review the existing research for exploiting the allocator, before demonstrating completely new techniques that expand what scenarios are possible to exploit. Attendees will gain a proper understanding of the motivations behind scudo's design choices, and the go-to techniques for exploiting the allocator.

## 12:00pm - Making ECC Fast - Rohan McLure
Cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL and GNU Nettle form the backbone of security in the current day. Proving authenticity online, establishing secure communication channels etc all depend on complex mathematical structures, including algebraic groups on Elliptic Curves.

But what is an Elliptic Curve? This talk will discuss the underlying arithmetic used in ECC, why it might be unwise to roll your own crypto (even if you understand the maths), and how to perform both fast (and secure) finite field arithmetic.

Come along if you have an interest in the mathematics of cryptography and better understanding how it is implemented.

## 1:30pm - Bringing Harmony to IIS: Using game mods to protect (or nuke) your web server - Adrian
With an ever increasing number of developers using .NET based game engines, game modders have developed sophisticated tools which can interact with the .NET Common Language Runtime to modify game mechanics, add features and fundamentally modify how games operate at runtime.

But what's stopping us from using these tools to mess with other .NET based applications? Say...an IIS web server running Microsoft Exchange?

Absolutely Nothing!

Join me as I deploy Harmony, a popular .NET method hooking library, onto a Microsoft IIS server inorder to access (and tamper with) method parameters, return values and functionality.

I'll demonstrate several methods to load Harmony into IIS before looking at the level of control Harmony gives us over various interesting methods regular web applications utilise.

Next I'll explore some defensive uses for method hooking including logging method parameters sent to commonly abused functions, preventing method calls, and messing with adversaries by tampering with outputs.

I'll also cover some offensive uses for method hooking such as password logging and persistence.

## 2:30pm - GetInjectedThreadEx: improved heuristics for suspicious thread creations - John Uhlmann
Since its debut in 2017, Get-InjectedThread.ps1 has been a blue team staple for identifying suspicious threads via their start addresses. However, red teams have subsequently identified low-cost evasion techniques to counteract this - obfuscating their shellcode threads with start addresses within legitimate modules.

This talk will outline the memory artifacts that each evasion leaves behind and the development of an updated script which may be used to detect them.

## 4:00pm - An abridged history of Linux kernel hardening - Russell Currey
The Linux kernel is everywhere. It's running on billions of devices here on Earth, and quite a few in space, too. Linux is big and complex: it does a lot of stuff, it runs on a lot of things, it's deployed in a lot of ways, and it has many distributions with many versions, each with their own modifications.

Linux is the dream target for attackers. It's everywhere. If there's low-hanging fruit in the kernel, your system is compromised.

Thankfully, the kernel has come a very long way in terms of defending itself against attacks. From the early days of accidental security features intended as debugging aids to modern fuzzers, sanitisers and hardware-assisted memory protections, Linux is a much tougher target than it used to be.

In this session, we'll recount the journey of an operating system and its community as they fail, learn and grow together. We'll explore the details of how many of the kernel's key hardening features work and how they came to be, the key moments in history that led to big changes in the community, and take a look at the state of Linux security in the modern era.

### Bio:
Russell is a Linux kernel hacker primarily focused on memory protections and microarchitectural security. By day he leads the Linux hardening team for IBM Power, by night he is an avid Linux gamer and desktop ricer.

## 5:00pm - The Dark Side of Large Language Models: Uncovering and Overcoming of Vulnerabilities - Javan Rasokat
As the use of AI in cybersecurity continues to grow, many researchers have looked to large language models (LLMs) to help identify vulnerabilities in code. However, recent studies have shown that LLMs may not be as effective as initially thought, and can even introduce new vulnerabilities into code. This talk will explore the potential risks and challenges associated with using LLMs for vulnerability detection, including the potential for introducing new vulnerabilities into code.

One example of this is the recent introduction of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered tool that generates code based on natural language prompts. While Copilot has been hailed as a revolutionary tool for developers, it has also been found to produce code with vulnerabilities, highlighting the potential risks associated with using LLMs for vulnerability detection.

In this presentation, we will showcase instances of AI-generated vulnerabilities, despite the incorporation of Copilots' “AI-based real time vulnerability filtering system”. However, we will also delve into the ways in which AI prompt engineering can be tailored to address this problem and emphasize the significance of secure coding practices. We will also discuss the importance of carefully validating the output of LLMs and conducting manual code reviews to ensure that any vulnerabilities introduced by LLMs are identified and addressed.

Additionally, we will review recent research in the area of AI-based vulnerability detection. By the end of this talk, attendees will have a better understanding of the benefits and limitations of AI-based vulnerability detection as well as code generation and will be able to make informed decisions about when and how to incorporate these tools into their own security review and software development practices.

## 11:30am - Don’t Lookaside or you’ll miss it: Turning a HyperV cache miss into 200k cash - Leo Adrien
Hyper-V has long been considered a prestige target for security researchers, with Microsoft offering high value bug bounties, and performing continuous in-house testing and attack-surface hardening. In this presentation I’ll show how I turned the discovery of a seemingly unreproducible bug into a critical-rated arbitrary code execution vulnerability, which was awarded MSRC’s maximum bounty.

The talk will begin with a very brief introduction to virtualization and Hyper-V, before launching into an in-depth examination of the low-level VMBus protocol which underpins guest-host communication. We will cover the mechanisms VMBus uses for signaling, shared memory, and callback messages, and the different types of devices it supports. Finally, I will trace the flow of a VMBus message from a guest VM all the way through to a host device driver in order to demonstrate the attack surface exposed by VMBus.

To finish this presentation I will dive into the details of a bug I discovered in early 2023 in a core VMBus host driver. In the journey to create a reliable proof-of-concept I will explain how to modify the Linux kernel’s Hyper-V guest drivers to craft our own custom VMBus packets, discuss a novel method of manipulating the Windows kernel’s LookasideList cache implementation from inside a guest VM, and finally, demonstrate how I won an incredibly precise race between host kernel threads to trigger the vulnerability.

You know that little box in the corner of your house doing all the heavy lifting required to connect you (and, now that everyone is working from home, your company) with the rest of the world? Yeah, that one. It's no secret that these things are oftentimes security nightmares for consumers, but have ISPs or the various networking vendors improved things over the years, or are they still just as terrible as we all think they are?

Over the last couple of years, we've done a deep dive into many of these devices to see what makes them tick and evaluate the risks posed to consumers. In this talk, we'll provide a rapid fire assessment of a handful of these devices, showcase the commonalities between flaws discovered, shed some light on behind-the-scenes supply chain issues plaguing this industry, and discuss where we see things going from here.
