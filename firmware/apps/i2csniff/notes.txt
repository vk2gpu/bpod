Limited i2c traffic sniffing tool. Due to small buffers and limited chip speed,
this is a best-effort to read and decode i2c traffic. Attach bPod to i2c lines
running between an existing master and slave(s) following the wiring diagram.

Example:
 S20W+13+FF+s
  S : start bit
  20: addr
  W : write
  + : ack
  13: data
  FF: data
  s : stop bit
