The MCP23017 is a GPIO expander chip. To control the GPIO, follow the wiring diagram 
to connect the needed power and I2C lines. Each I2C device has its own address ranging 
from 0x00 to 0x7f. The MCP23017 allows you to set its address using pins A0 A1 A2. If you 
connect A0 A1 A2 to GND, the address is 0x20. If you connect A0 A1 A2 to 3V, the address 
is 0x2f. Hence you can have multiple devices connected to the one pair of SDA/SCK wires. Make sure 
you select the correct I2C address so your GPIO commands go to the right chip.
