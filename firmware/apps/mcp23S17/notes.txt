The MCP23S17 is a GPIO expander chip. To control the GPIO, follow the wiring diagram 
to connect the needed power and SPI lines. MISO stands for MASTER IN SLAVE OUT and needs 
to be connected to the SLAVE OUT (SO). MOSI stands for MASTER OUT SLAVE IN and needs 
to be connected to the SLAVE IN (IN). A clock signal controlled by the master (bPod) signals 
when data is transfered. Clock is commonly labeled SCK or CLK. To select the slave device, a 
Chip Select (CS) wire is used. CS is often ACTIVE LOW - meaning that the slave is selected 
when the CS line is low or no voltage (instead of high/3V). In schematics, this is shown with 
a line drawn across the top of CS label.
