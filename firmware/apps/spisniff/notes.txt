Limited SPI traffic sniffing tool. Due to small buffers and limited chip speed, 
this is a best-effort to read and decode SPI traffic. Attach bPod to SPI lines running 
between an existing master and slave following the wiring diagram. You need to connect the 
CS line so that only the selected slave is sniffed. Works with 10000Hz CLK, faster is going to get 
unreliable very quickly. NOTE that the wiring diagram DOES NOT use the marked SPI pins on 
the bPod - this would stop the screen working so we use other pins.
Example:
 12:34+56:78+
  12 : MOSI
  34 : MISO
  56 : MOSI
  78 : MISO
