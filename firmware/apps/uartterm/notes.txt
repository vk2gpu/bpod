To view UART messages, use the wiring diagram to 
join the bPod to the other device. Once wired, select 
baud rate (how fast the other device is transmitting) and 
config (data bits, parity bit and stop bit).

Example 8N1:
 - 8 data bits
 - No parity bit
 - 1 stop bit

You can then select Terminal to start seeing messages. You can 
press play to stop and resume the capture. Note that you 
wire TX-->RX and RX-->TX between devices.

If using USB, this becomes a terminal - exit with CTRL+Q.
